# Visual Active Effects
Visualize your active effects.

While the module is enabled, all temporary effects (including status conditions) affecting your current token will be displayed in the top right.
* Double-clicking an effect will toggle it between enabled and disabled.
* Right-clicking an effect will let you delete it.
* A GM can shift-right-click an effect for quick deletion.

The below video demonstrates how to use it and how it looks, using an effect created by the module Concentration Notifier as an example.
